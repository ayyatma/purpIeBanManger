# BanManager

A comprehensive mod for Hades 2 that allows you to ban specific boons, hexes, and upgrades from various sources, giving you fine-grained control over your runs.

The mod uses a config menu configuration instead of profiles. It supports bonus Olympians such as Artemis, Athena, and Dionysus, as well as NPC blessings from Arachne, Narcissus, Echo, Hades, Medea, and Circe. Additionally, it allows for banning Selene spells and Daedalus upgrades, and includes an option to force the first boon to be Epic rarity.

## Features

### Boon/Hex Banning
- **God Boons**: Ban individual boons from all Olympian gods (Zeus, Poseidon, Athena, etc.)
- **NPC Blessings/Curses**: Ban specific offerings from NPCs like Arachne, Narcissus, Circe, etc.
- **Selene Spells**: Ban individual lunar spells from Selene encounters
- **Daedalus Upgrades**: Ban specific hammer upgrades (Staff, Dagger, Axe, Torch, Lob (Skull), Suit (Coat))
- **Hades Keepsakes**: Separate banning controls for keepsake boons vs. regular Hades boons
